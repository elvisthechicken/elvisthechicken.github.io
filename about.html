            It was a warm summers day, a man
            was born under a rainbow spouting 
            forth from a Unicorn's vagina. 
            ALEX COOK - THE CHOSEN ONE.
            Despite being born with blonde 
            curly hair and looking like a girl
            he was to become the Jesus of 
            drunks, a bounder and a cad. A man
            destined for legendary awesomeness
            and saving the universe (not 
            necessarily in that order).
          </p>

          <p>
            His path of drunken righteousness
            was fraught. At 15, he was shot in
            the face (not like that!) and
            survived. Not through any kind
            of divine intervention mind,
            but by having balls so big, that
            they have their own gravitational
            field and thus changed the trajectory
            of the projectile to miss his brain.
          </p>

          <p>
            With his unlikely band of heroes, THE
            BRAIN TRUST, Alex strides the path to
            beer nirvana. It is upon this path that
            he stumbled upon THE PENGUIN (some people
            call her Amy). In order to save the
            Universe, a union must be made between The
            Penguin and Alex.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            All is not well. For the evil overlord
            RITZY TONY will not allow such a union
            to take place unless Alex undertakes the
            challenge known as THE STAG DO. Trials
            and tribulations of epic proportions await
            to test our saviour and his alcholic mettle.
            Will he survive? Will he sacrifice the Brain
            Trust like the bounder he is? Time will tell...
